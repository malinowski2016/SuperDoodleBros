# SuperDoodleBros
Game Development Studio Final Project

Our game idea is a 2D, single player platformer. The player will control a character whose goal is to stay alive as long as possible. 
The player must keep up with the platforms as they scroll vertically, and there are enemies who can spawn from any direction that can 
kill the player as well. The player will have some weapons to kill the enemies, and more powerful weapons will be available as the 
player progresses. 

Games such as Super Mario Bros and Doodle Jump inspired this game. We liked the platform and enemy style of Doodle Jump, but we wanted
more control over the movement of the character and more ways to fight enemies than either Doodle Jump or Super Mario Bros allowed. We
also think that having the game continuously scroll we will add an interesting new element that neither game has used.  

Q1: Is the game’s fiction urgent?
  The game’s sense of urgency is established using a continuously scrolling map with randomly spawning lethal enemy units. This 
  environment contributes to a constant and dynamic struggle for survival.

Q2: What is the player’s job?
  The player’s job is to survive

Q3. What are the verbs?
  Jump, Shoot, Climb, Collect

Q4: Do actions support each other?
  Switching between weapons 

Q5. What are your mechanics types?
  -Board and space mechanics are present in planning a course of action in order to avoid enemies on the map while also jumping between 
   platforms, reaching ladders or collecting treasures.
  -Types of guns and enemies
  -We introduce uncertainty in the form of platforms of random types and positions spawning along with random enemies.

Q6. What’s the defining rule?
  The map is constantly scrolling upwards

Q7. What are you testing?
  We are testing player reaction time, strategy and adaptability in response to the introduction of new obstacles
